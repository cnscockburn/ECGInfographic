## The ECG: How does it work, and why?

The ECG is an important tool that physiologists, clinicians, and researchers use to gain information about the electrical activity of the heart.

## The Infographic

This infographic was created as part of a coursework assignment for Physiology 1A for Biomedical Engineers at the University of Bristol.
